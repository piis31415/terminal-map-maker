# Terminal Map Maker

This project was created to help build layouts for strategy in the [Terminal game by Correlation 1](https://terminal.c1games.com). This version includes a build order constructor as well as C++ array text import/exports.

The original Map Maker can be found at: [https://www.kevinbai.design/terminal-map-maker](https://www.kevinbai.design/terminal-map-maker); this version can be found at [https://terminal-map-maker.vercel.app](https://terminal-map-maker.vercel.app).

It was created with React and rendered with NextJS (hosted on a server which uses NextJS for routing and rendering). More specifically, this repository was bootstrapped with `create-next-app`.

## Installation

Clone this repository and execute `npm install` in terminal. Then, you can host the server locally using `npm run dev`.
